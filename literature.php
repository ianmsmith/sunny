<h3>Sonnet 77</h3> 

- William Shakespeare<br>
<p>
<i><b>Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,<br>
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;</b><br>
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,<br>
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.<br>
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show<br>
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;<br>
<b>Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know<br>
Time's thievish progress to eternity.</b><br>
Look, what thy memory can not contain<br>
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find<br>
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,<br>
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.<br>
These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,<br>
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.<br>
</i>

<h3>Sonnet 104</h3>      

- William Shakespeare<br>
<p>
<i>
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,<br>
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,<br>
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold<br>
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,<br>
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd<br>
In process of the seasons have I seen,<br>
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,<br>
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.<br>
<b>Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,<br>
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;</b><br>
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,<br>
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:<br>
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;<br>
Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.<br>
